A rough idea of the story we have in mind:
A girl(or boy), maybe 8-9 years old has a nightmare(we will be showing the nightmare and make it playable). He sees some disturbing stuff(not exactly sure what right now, but something spookyish maybe).
He/she wakes up and sees darkness all around.. is scared.. turns on the light(the user will have to do so using arrow keys and e) we will put some interactable stuff around the room, which 
gives us an idea about the boy/girl. 
When he finally proceeds to the hall outside.. he sees chaos all around him.. pictures stripped of the wall, broken things, and so on. Calls for parents, no answer.
Goes downstairs(his room wil be in first floor) sees even more chaos (maybe even some blood??) and weird noises from the basement of the house.
The radio crackles to life (assume older time period) and random messages blare out.. in the middle of it clearer 'RUN! DANGER' (or something equally weird). 
some other random stuff not exactly decided yet.. I have an idea as to what is supposed to be done in the story, however not sure of the exact stuff.. so you guys can look through it and 
add stuff.
Code will be added once we learn about what we are supposed to be doing.
